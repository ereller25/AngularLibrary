AngularJS
Primarily used on single view applications


MVC - Model View Controller

Model
  - Data
  - JSON, database entries, etc.

View
  - Displays content & data to a use in a browser
  - HTML
  - Uses expressions to insert data
    - <html tag> {{data}} <html tag>

Controller
  - Functionality of our views
  - Interaction between models and views
  - Different controllers for different area of app, what makes it all work

Example
  - User clicks 'show users' button
  - A 'UserController' starts a function on a  button click
  - Function communicates with the 'users' model and pulls all the user data
  - The controllers passes the data to the view and shows it via and expression

  Sometimes called MVW - Model View Whatever


File Structure for this Library
  - HTML files with an app.js are called by matching files
    - This is for specific demos, normally would have an app.js and individual controllers
